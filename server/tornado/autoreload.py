"""A module to automatically restart the server when a module is modified.

Most applications should not call this module directly.  Instead, pass the
keyword argument ``debug=True`` to the `tornado.web.Application` constructor.
This will enable autoreload mode as well as checking for changes to templates
and static resources.

This module depends on IOLoop, so it will not work in WSGI applications
and Google AppEngine.  It also will not work correctly when HTTPServer's
multi-process mode is used.
